> To me, the important thing in Real Agile is to pick the next few things to do, and do them promptly. The key question is to find the most valuable things to do, and to do them quickly. Doing them quickly comes down to doing small slices of high value, and iterating rapidly.

> The most common characteristic I see behind truly productive tech work is that the people involved prioritize building the right product above everything else. They build it in small cycles and validate it, which follows the agile philosophy, but they don’t limit themselves to a strict agile recipe. They sometimes borrow some elements of an agile recipe, but only because it helps them build the right product. For example, they have recurring meetings only if there’s a good justification for them. And, instead of letting the methodology dictate every single interaction, they hold impromptu meetings on an as-needed basis, even at five minute’s notice, all in the name of improving the product.
